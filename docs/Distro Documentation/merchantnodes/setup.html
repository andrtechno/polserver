</div>
<div id="content"><big id="fred"><big style="font-weight: bold;">Placing
a node:</big><br>
To install a merchant node, you must know the following information
before you begin:<br>
Largest radius of the room to monitor. this can be determined by
standing in the exact center of the room and counting the tiles to the
furthest wall. Keep in mind that the nodes check line of sight. So for
buildings that are not rectangular, you must base your centering on the
assumption that the building is rectangular. once you have your radius,
you must create your NPCs.<br>
<br>
Note that merchant NPCs are designed to be permanent and should <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> be
created by the .createnpc command or a spawn point. Use the .createnode
command to begin setting up the node.<br>
<br>
</big>

</big></big><img src="file:///C:/Users/Me/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg" alt=""><br>
<b><br>
</b><big>The createnode gump is pretty straight forward. simply fill in
the
radius in the spot labeled “Define Listener Range” and choose whether
the node controls merchants or bankers. Choose Merchant for this
tutorial. Setting a node to "banker" will cause the node not to run
restock. So do not use this setting on normal merchants.<br>
<br>
The "Next Respawn" field is the amount of time between restocks in
minutes. Each npc will restock his inventory on that interval. The
default of 30 minutes is recommended for all merchants except reagent
vendors which seem to work best at 12 minute restock intervals. Once
all the relevant information is entered, click the "okay" button.<br>
<br>
You will get a target cursor. This is for placing the node. Place the
node at the center of the room, even if it is within a wall or outside
the actual building.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using the node:</span></big><br>
Once the node is created, double-click on it and a gump will appear.
</big><big>If you do not see the node, use the .info command and target
yourself. Click the blue button next to Pivileges. In the list of
privileges click the blue button next to seeinvis to enable seeing
invisible items. </big><big>Before we look at the gump in detail,
let's spawn your first merchant.
There is a checkbox in the upper left hand side of the gump. Click on
that to create a merchant. The gump will disappear and you will be
asked to enter the type of merchant you wish to spawn. Enter alchemist
and press &lt;enter&gt;. You will receive a target cursor. Choose
where you wish the merchant to appear. The node will spawn the merchant
at that location. Please note that it my take up to 60 seconds for the
merchant to appear in game.<br>
<br>
There are occasions when you might want more than one merchant in a
shop or location. So to place another merchant use the node again
(double-click) and click on the checkbox in the gump and follow the
procedure above for placing another merchant.<br>
<br>
</big>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big>The
merchant node gump:</big></big></span><big><big><br>
</big></big><img src="file:///C:/Users/Me/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-5.jpg" alt=""><br>
<br>
<big>This is an example of a merchant node gump. At the top left you
see the number of enabled merchants on the left side of the slash and
the total number of merchants created by this node on the right. In
this cae three enabled of three created. The node has been used to
spawn three merchants, a tailor, a mage, and an alchemist. You can see
it shows the merchant type and its location. Note that the location
information does not show the realm. This is because a node can only be
used to spawn merchants in the same realm as the node.<br>
<br>
There are also three check boxes next to each merchant listed, Enabled,
Delete, and Rebuild Stock. If the merchant is enabled its information
will be shown in green and the Enabled check box will have a check
mark. To disable a merchant click on the check box and click the Apply
button in the lower left. Disabling a merchant will remove it from the
game world but not from the node.This can be useful when you wish to
setup nodes with certain merchants that are only available at certain
times such as during quests. When a merchant is disabled its
information will be shown in red. The Delete button is used to delete a
merchant from the node. To delete a merchant check the Delete check box
and click the Apply button. Once you click the Apply button the
merchant will be deleted. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This
operation cannot be reversed.</span> The Rebuild Stock option is not
enabled and thus the check box does nothing.<br>
<br>
At the bottom left just above the Apply and Cancel buttons are two
radio buttons, Enable Node and Disable Node. You can only activate one button. When a node is enabled it
will appear as a bright glowing green crystal. When a node is disabled
it appears as a dark green crystal. When you disable a node the
merchants will be removed from the world but not from the node. If you
re-enable a node, the merchants will be respawned in the world.<br>
<br>
On the lower right of the gump are two check boxes, Restock Merchants
and Respawn Merchants. Restock Merchants will instantly restock the
inventory for all merchants on this node. This is useful if you are
running a quest and players are buying out a particular merchant's
inventory faster than the restock time the node may have been set to at
creation. Use the Respawn Merchants check box for times when a merchant
might have been killed. Please note that the merchants in the Distro
are set to be invulnerable. So they cannot be killed. You are free to
change their invulnerable privilege by editing their templates in the
npcdesc.cfg file located in the main /config directory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Remember no choices will take effect until you click the Apply button.<br>
