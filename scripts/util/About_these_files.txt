Some of these files are usedd in scripts containe in the Distro and some are not.

All of the include files in this folder were originally shipped with the POL 0.95
Distro upon which this Distro is based. I am not sure why the original developers
included unused files in the Distro. I asssume they were intended to be used as a
source of useful functions for other developers to use in their code. So I am
including them in this version of the Distro.
